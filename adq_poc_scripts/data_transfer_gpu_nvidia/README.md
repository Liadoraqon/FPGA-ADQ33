# README

This example demonstrates streaming to an Nvidia GPU using Nvidia GPUdirect RDMA.
GPUdirect RDMA is only supported by professional GPUs, specified as GPUDirect
in datasheet. This only works for Linux.

# Default behavior

The *default* behavior of the example application is to receive 10000 buffers
on each channel using an integrated periodic trigger. The input signal is a
ramp generated by a *test pattern generator*. To acquire ADC data,
set`TEST_PATTERN_SOURCE` to `ADQ_TEST_PATTERN_SOURCE_DISABLE` (disabled) in
the settings file `settings.py`.


# Structure

The application can be broken down into six stages:

1. GPU identification and initialization
2. Digitizer identification
3. Digitizer configuration (configuration parameters are located in the header file
   `settings.py`)
4. GPU buffer allocation
5. Data acquisition
6. Summary and cleanup

The source code includes comments to highlight and explain important actions.

# Compilation

* Install Nvidia drivers.
* Install CUDA
* Run example .../data_transfer_gpu_nvidia$ python streaming_nvidia.py
